Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that enables the modularization of cross-cutting concerns in software applications. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of your application that affect multiple parts of the codebase. These can include logging, security, transactions, and error handling. AOP allows you to separate these concerns from the core application logic, making your code more maintainable and less cluttered.

Aspect: An aspect is a module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. It contains advice and pointcuts.

Advice: Advice is the code that runs when a particular pointcut is matched. There are different types of advice, including “before,” “after,” “around,” and “after-throwing.”

Pointcut: A pointcut is an expression that defines where an aspect’s advice should be applied in the codebase. It selects specific join points in your application.

Join Point: A join point is a specific point in the execution of a program, such as a method call, constructor invocation, or field access.
